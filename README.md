# pytorch_slime
Slime "simulations" using the PyTorch library. Currenly, the code is a loose reimplementation of the ideas presented in [__this YouTube video__](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A)[(Github link)](https://github.com/SebLague/Slime-Simulation) by Sebastian Lague.

This repository is my own playground for learning and experimenting with new ideas.

Lots of cleaning to the code and improvements are required. Feel free to make any suggestions.
